# 1->matrix
# traction of matrix is used for strength calculation
# 2->fiber
# traction of fiber is used for strength calculation
# 3->aveTrac
# average traction of matrix and fiber is used for strength calculation
# 4->aveEffStress
# effective stress is calculated separately from fiber and matrix. Finally, the average of the two are taken
# 5->minEffStress
# minimum of strengths calculated from fiber and matrix is taken
